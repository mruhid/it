            <p class="b"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Orange_tabby_cat_sitting_on_fallen_leaves-Hisashi-01A.jpg/800px-Orange_tabby_cat_sitting_on_fallen_leaves-Hisashi-01A.jpg" style="float:left;padding-right:20px" width="200px" height="200px"> It is noteworthy that the  ancestors of the other common household pet, the dog, were social animals that lived together in packs in which there was subordination to a leader, and the dog has readily transferred its allegiance from pack leader to human master. The cat, however, has not yielded as readily to subjugation. Consequently, the house cat is able to revert to complete self-reliance more quickly and more successfully than most domesticated dogs. For an account of the relationship of the family of cats to other carnivores, see carnivore.
                The earliest known association between cats and humans dates possibly as far back as the origins of agriculture in the Middle East, about 9,500 years ago. A cat skeleton accompanying that of a human dated to that time was discovered in southern Cyprus.
